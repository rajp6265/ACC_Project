Rules and policies
Copyright













Overview
Fair use
Making claims
Enforcing copyright




The first rule of copyright
Creators should only upload videos that they have made or that they're authorised to use. That means that they should not upload videos that they didn't make, or use content in their videos that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programmes or videos made by other users, without necessary authorisations.


What is fair use?
Fair use is a US law that allows the reuse of copyright-protected material under certain circumstances without getting permission from the copyright owner. However, fair use is determined on a case-by-case basis, and different countries have different rules about when it's acceptable to use material without the copyright owner's permission. In the US, works of commentary, criticism, research, teaching or news reporting might be considered fair use, but it can depend on the situation.
We created the YouTube Audio Library to help creators reuse content safely by providing free high-quality music and sound effects.

How can rightsholders make copyright claims?
Everyone has access to YouTube's Copyright Management Tools, which give rightsholders control of their copyrighted material on YouTube. We work with rightsholders to match them to appropriate features based on the scale of their copyrighted content on YouTube and the resources that they've dedicated to responsibly managing their content online. Our Copyright Management Suite provides a number of ways for rightsholders to make copyright claims.
Webform
The simplest way to have unauthorised copies of copyrighted content removed is by manually submitting a copyright notification through our DMCA (Digital Millennium Copyright Act) webform.
